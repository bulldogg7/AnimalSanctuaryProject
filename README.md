# AnimalSanctuaryProject

## Description
	- Create an animal sanctuary where there are a variety of animals (pig, cat, cow, lion, etc.) that make different noises (oink, meow, moo, roar, etc.)
	- Store a number of animals in the sanctuary
	- Have an attendant that visits the animals and feeds them if they are hungry and make a noise
	- Create a menu of user options to list the current animals, add an animal, feed the animals, or exit the program.

## Technologies Used
	- Java
	- Eclipse
	- Sublime
	- Git/GitHub
	- MacOS Terminal

## Lessons Learned
	- Always commit your work so that it saves
	- Learned how to use classes and subclasses
	- Learned how to use multiple files to communicate with one another to run the program
	- Learned to use a do-while loop & if-else statements to display a menu
	- Used getters & setters, fields, constructors, polymorphism, and toStrings

## Changes Made
	- Refined User Experience with verbiage and formatting
	- Changed errors made in applying fields and methods to the Animal class when it should have been in the subclasses of Dog, Cat, Chicken, etc.
